To install:
1. Upload the files to your web server.
2. Navigate your browser to the location where you uploaded your files.
   For example: http://example.com/grape/
3. It should display "The installer needs to be run before Grape can function properly."
   Click on the "installer" link, and it should take you to the installation wizard to guide you through the rest of the process.
   Alternatively, go directly to http://<your-website>/grape/install.php
