# Todo - Grapefruit

This is a list of things that should be worked on for the first beta release of Grapefruit
(for those unaware, the current status of CleanerGrape is SUPER DEVELOPMENT, DON'T TRY IF YOU
DON'T WANT BUGS).

## Big Things

 * Create a SearchTerms extension (in progress. The referrer extension should now record what I 
 need for it to work (because it's nice to know what search terms get people to your site)).

## Fun Things

Fun things as defined as things that would be nice to ipliment but aren't needed.

 * Create an API for getting data from Grapefruit to another application. I mean, right now
 you can essentially just use the database to get the data, but that's not always an option. 
 Plus it could be used to add a number of visitors this DATERANGE to your own site.
