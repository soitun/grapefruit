# CleanerGrape

CleanerGrape is a custom Grape Analytics installation that comes prebundled with a nicer theme.
The main goal of CleanerGrape is to keep everything that Grape has, but add a slightly cleaner
and better laid out theme than a vanilla Grape install.

## Installation Notes

This is a development version, that means that I'm putting working files in the repo, so you need to clear out the `extensions.php` file until it becomes
    <?php
    
    ?>



## Additional Notes

* CleanerGrape is licensed under the GPL like Grape itself.
* CleanerGrape is under development right now, and may eventually move to being it's own program and not just a look and feel change to Grape.
* If you have any questions on how or why I did certain things, feel free to email me grape@dkuntz2.com
