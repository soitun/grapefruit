# Grapefruit

Grapefruit is a complete overhaul to Grape Analytics. Grapefruit takes the basis of Grape and modifies some components to work
better, and adds new features.

Grapefruit was formerly known as CleanerGrape, and references to CleanerGrape may be found in the code right now (same as references to Grape itself).
